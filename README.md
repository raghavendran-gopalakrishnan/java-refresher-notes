Hello there, if you are reading this you must be a fellow senior Java developer who kind of lost touch of fundamentals -> advanced Core Java concepts and best practices while you were busy with your day to day work. Well, you are not alone. 

In this Github repo, I have vowed to myself that I will document my journey towards rediscovering my love for Java, satisfy my knowledge thirst and keep myself and you updated.

Let's get started!


### Vision of this Journey 

I have a vague idea on how this is going to end up with :
- I will take this up on a weekly basis and document the progress from fundamentals of Java till Multithreading/concurrency and everything in between.
- This repo will not be anything related to any web developement frameworks, just in case if you are wondering.
- Intention of this Github repo is to rekindle the Java knowledege that you are already possessing and help you while you are preparing for an interview or taking an interview or you know, just to keep your Java knowledge in edge of your mind.

This space will be updated to have Table of Contents as and when this repo grows gradually.
