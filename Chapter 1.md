# JAVA - The What's, the Why's and more

First of all, let's raise a toast for [James Gosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling), the brain behind.

## WHAT :

Java was developed and designed in the Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle in 2010) in the 90's as a statically typed Object Oriented Programming language, borrowing much of syntaxes from C and C++. 

Java's standard implementation comes with :
* **JRE** - Java Runtime Environment, which provides a runtime environment for the Java class to execute in the end-user's system.
* **JDK** - Java Development Kit, which provides the development tools and utils, which helps developer to compile the Java code into byte-code which the machine with JRE insalled can understand and execute.

Java program is structured with Classes encapsulating the methods and variables.

      class HelloWorld { 
           public static void main(String args[]) { 
                System.out.println("Hello World!"); 
            } 
        }

## WHY:

- Its simple and portable.
- Its Object oriented.
- Platform independent.
- Secure
- Endless libraries both in the language and open source as well.
- High performance and robustness
- Multithreaded
